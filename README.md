The provided code creates a simple 3D lamp using Three.js in a React application. The lamp consists of two parts: a cylindrical base and a conical lampshade. The lamp can rotate continuously when it's turned on, providing a subtle animation.
Here's a breakdown of the shapes used to construct the lamp:

Cylindrical Base:
Geometry: Cylinder
Dimensions: The base has a radius of 1, a height of 2, and it is centered at the origin.
Material: Standard material with a color of either 'yellow' (when the lamp is on) or 'gray' (when the lamp is off).

Conical Lampshade:
Geometry: Cone
Dimensions: The lampshade has a bottom radius of 1.5, a top radius of 2, a height of 8, and it is positioned above the base at y = 4.
Material: Standard material with a color of either 'yellow' (when the lamp is on) or 'gray' (when the lamp is off).

When the lamp is turned on, both the base and the lampshade will have a yellow color. When turned off, both will have a gray color. The lamp rotates around the y-axis, providing a simple and continuous animation.
